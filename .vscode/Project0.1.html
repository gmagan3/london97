        <p> Many people these days are fearful of credit cards. We are taught from birth that a credit card is an easy way to <a href="https://watchyourbuck.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/istock_debt.jpg">debt</a> While it's true that if you aren't smart that there is a whole lot of trouble you can get into. However with just a little research and forethought you can open a whole world of traveling beyond your <a href="https://cdn1.thr.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/landscape_928x523/2015/09/wildest_dreams_music_video_still.jpg">wildest dreams</a> And no that won't be my last Taylor Swift reference so strap in. </p> 
        
        <a href="#biggest_misconceptions"> Biggest Misconceptions</a>

    <h2 id="biggest_misconceptions"> Biggest Misconceptions</h2>
        <p>We are going to discuss the biggest misconceptions people have about credit cards and why they are unfounded.</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Credit Score</li> <br />
            <p> First thing people think of when at the prospect of getting credit cards is how much their credit score will tank when getting new cards. Rather it is actually better to get a credit card as early as possible in life to actually build your <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/credit-card-raise-credit-score/">credit score</a>. Now this logic might seem counterinuitive but stay with me here. The reason for a credit score is to judge whether a bank or the government should extend you a line of credit. It has been proven that with managed payments and a long line of positive credit history you can attain a high credit score.</p>
            <li> Debt</li>
            <p> The second thing people automatically associate with credit cards is crushing debt. It's hard not to think of friends you know with crushing debt or when you see articles like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/23/credit-card-debt-hits-record-high.html">this</a> The truth is when it comes to money the average American is careless and act as if a credit card is a loan from the bank that never needs to pay back. That is until it is way too late and that is how bank make their money.The point of this post is to simply say that with a little bit of common sense and research there can be a way to beat simply the average.</p>
